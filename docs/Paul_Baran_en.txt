Paul Baran (1926-2011) was a Polish-born American engineer and scientist who played a prominent role in the development of data transmission and network theory. Baran worked in the electronics industry after World War II and rose to prominence at the research institute RAND Corporation.

He is best known for his work during the age of the "information explosion," when the United States government expressed concern about the resilience of communications networks in the event of a possible nuclear attack. Baran, in a report published in 1964, "On Distributed Communications," described in detail the so-called the concept of "packet switching", which forms the basis of the Internet and other modern networks. Thanks to packet switching, data is divided into small packets and transmitted on different routes, which provides networks with greater resilience and scalability.

Paul Baran held many patents during his lifetime and his work was fundamental to the development of the Internet. The principles of packet switching were key to the development of the ARPANET, the first true forerunner of the Internet for military communications.

Baran died in 2011 in Palo Alto, California, Spain. His legacy and work will remain with his outstanding role in the development of the Internet and the development of modern communication networks.
